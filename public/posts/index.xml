      <description>Hey everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m currently moving my blog over to Hugo as opposed to write.bz. I like write.bz, and while it might be tough losing federation, I think that this is the best move for the blog moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving all of my posts over at some point in the near term future.</description>

      <description>An Introductory Post Hello -
Bear with me since this is my first blog post. I’ll try to keep it short and sweet.
My name is Mason. I’m a creative living in Chicago. I use the vague word “creative” here because I’m a bit of a Jack of all trades, master of none. Basically, my ideas to output ratio is very low (likely as a result of my ADHD). A lot of different mediums resonate with me, but I have trouble seeing things through.</description>
