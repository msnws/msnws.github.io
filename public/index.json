I like write.bz, and while it might be tough losing federation, I think that this is the best move for the blog moving forward. I\u0026rsquo;ll be moving all of my posts over at some point in the near term future.","tags":[],"title":"New Blog, Who Dis?"},{"date":"2023-08-31","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"msnws.online/posts/productivity/","summary":"Just wanted to lay out a thought that’s been bouncing around my head now for a while.\nAs I left school and confronted the pressures and responsibilities that come with adult life, I quickly realized that my previous strategy of half-assing my life quickly wasn’t effective anymore. You can’t half-ass an office job. You can’t half-ass paying your bills on time. If you want to make people feel comfortable in your home, you can’t half-ass things like taking out the trash or keeping your place clean.","tags":[],"title":"Productivity, ADHD and Perfectionism"},{"date":"2023-07-06","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"msnws.online/posts/threads/","summary":"This will be my only post about Threads since I don’t care to give it the time or attention it doesn’t need.\nAs it stands right now, it feels chaotic and impersonal. While Mastodon feels like a nice community where I follow real blogs (micro as they may be) that I’m interested in. Threads feels like the old social media dick measuring contest to see who can make the most bottom-of-the-barrel joke the fastest and subsequently rake in the most likes/reposts the fastest.","tags":[],"title":"Threads"},{"date":"2023-06-29","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"msnws.online/posts/an-introductory-post/","summary":"Hello -\nBear with me since this is my first blog post. I’ll try to keep it short and sweet.\nMy name is Mason. I’m a creative living in Chicago. I use the vague word “creative” here because I’m a bit of a Jack of all trades, master of none. Basically, my ideas to output ratio is very low (likely as a result of my ADHD). A lot of different mediums resonate with me, but I have trouble seeing things through.","tags":[],"title":"An Introductory Post"},{"date":"0001-01-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"msnws.online/manifest/index.json","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Manifest"}],
