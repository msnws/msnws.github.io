      <description>Hey everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m currently moving my blog over to Hugo as opposed to write.bz. I like write.bz, and while it might be tough losing federation, I think that this is the best move for the blog moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving all of my posts over at some point in the near term future.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to lay out a thought that’s been bouncing around my head now for a while.
As I left school and confronted the pressures and responsibilities that come with adult life, I quickly realized that my previous strategy of half-assing my life quickly wasn’t effective anymore. You can’t half-ass an office job. You can’t half-ass paying your bills on time. If you want to make people feel comfortable in your home, you can’t half-ass things like taking out the trash or keeping your place clean.</description>

      <description>This will be my only post about Threads since I don’t care to give it the time or attention it doesn’t need.
As it stands right now, it feels chaotic and impersonal. While Mastodon feels like a nice community where I follow real blogs (micro as they may be) that I’m interested in. Threads feels like the old social media dick measuring contest to see who can make the most bottom-of-the-barrel joke the fastest and subsequently rake in the most likes/reposts the fastest.</description>

      <description>Hello -
Bear with me since this is my first blog post. I’ll try to keep it short and sweet.
My name is Mason. I’m a creative living in Chicago. I use the vague word “creative” here because I’m a bit of a Jack of all trades, master of none. Basically, my ideas to output ratio is very low (likely as a result of my ADHD). A lot of different mediums resonate with me, but I have trouble seeing things through.</description>
